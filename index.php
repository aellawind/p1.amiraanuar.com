			<p>My name is Amira, and I'm currently a candidate for the Harvard Extension School 
				ALM in IT program. I know very basic HTML/CSS (from the old days in middle school
				when I learned it to customize my MySpace!) so I am eager to really dig in and 
				learn more. I've bought a book on HTML5/CSS3/Javascript/PHP to help me with this course.
				Some other fun things about me: I love moving around, so that includes dancing, running, 
				squash, hiking, tennis, biking, swimming, and skiing. I am a major foodie (who isn't?) and 
				when I stress out there is nothing more calming than mixing together a batch of brownies. I
				get very easily absorbed in whatever I'm doing, be it work, playing games, or a tv show.</p>

			<p>My text editor is Sublime, which is awesome!</p>
